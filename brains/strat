ESSAYER DE GARDER NOTRE DIRECTION EN MEMOIRE VIA DES LABELS

"init" :
repeat 5
"mouvement aléatoire"
mouvement aléatoire tant que l'on voit pas devant :

- AMI -> alors on tourne à droite et "mouvement aléatoire"

"recherche"
on garde sa direction 3/4 tourner à droite 1/4 tant qu'on arrive pas sur :

- One mur on tourne à droite et on continue
- à manger on grab et "retour base"
- One enemi on retourne à la base
- One ami

si on se trouve sur Onee case de base :

- drop la bouffe
- on tire aléatoirement notre comportement agressif 1/10 recherche 9/10

"retour base" :
si
